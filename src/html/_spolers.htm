                        Aliens, Quarters and Exotic Ships are the three collections that we are planning to release.
                        Their main goal is to help fund the development of the game and attract more investors to the
                        project. Right now, we are getting ready to release our first collection:

                    <p>
                        Alien PFP Collection - a collection of characters that differ in traits and rarity. When
                        “NoHoomans Pub” Pre-Alpha will be released, these characters will be integrated for in-game use
                        as playable skins and a key to access the NoHoomans Pub module of the Game. Please keep in mind
                        that the preparation of in-game skins will take time, most likely we will release them in small
                        bunches over 1 year.

                        The demo module of the Pub will be released and will operate as a “Social Hub” where all players
                        will be able to use different characters within the playable area. It will be available only for
                        PC
                        users.

                    <p>
                        A primitive in-game multiplayer system will be implemented to allow gamers to interact with each
                        other using integrated methods of communication and entertainment inside the demo version. This
                        will
                        serve as a base foundation for new game mechanics that will be added gradually.

                    <p>
                        The early demo will not require wallet connection or account registration. Both methods of the
                        authorization will be added when spaceships, vendors, trading, and the whole token integrated
                        ecosystem are introduced in the later version of the game. This will provide further access to
                        the
                        Pub location only for owners of our Alien PFP collection.

                        Our Ship Module will be introduced to NoHoomans Pub in August of 2022, it will feature a
                        complete interior design of the station, hangars for small, medium, and large ships. Most
                        importantly it will feature a "5 vs. 5" battle mode, where players will be able to test out
                        their ships and learn about the controls and UI functioning in Crypted Space.

                        This will be the next module of the game that will feature a massive UI update and a complete
                        station level that contains areas like Town Square, living quarters, black market, hangar, and
                        more.

                        Ship modules and weapons will be added to the game as well as a Ship Vendor that will be
                        available on the station. Players will be able to freely fly around in the Sector(Warp Jumps
                        won't be available yet).

                        Cost of the whole Project development is estimated for 2 years. This period implies the full
                        preparation before releasing the finished game including all the added modules, level design,
                        asset design, game mechanics, and marketing to operate at its full potential.

                        According to our plans, November 2022 is the month when NoHoomans will reach a stage suitable
                        for a Pre-Alpha. This is when the team will start focusing heavily on the development of the
                        main game.

                        buy and sell items. The supply is yet to be determined but a part of it will be used for testing
                        before the rest will be introduced in the game economy.

                        After we are certain that there are no weak points - the remaining supply will be distributed to
                        NPC’s, Factions and split among the players. This information is subject to change and more
                        details on the token and the in-game economy will be released in our Whitepaper for Crypted

                        By this point, we are planning to have all the basic game mechanics ready for the Alpha state.
                        This version of the game will require players to tie their wallets to the game website. All
                        in-game items will be tied to NFT’s being displayed in the player's wallet, and the integration
                        of the in-game token will begin to operate.

                    <p>
                        A small portion of the in-game world will be ready for players to explore. It will be filled
                        with NPC’s, Quests, New Ships, Star-Systems, Planets, Stations, and various other in-game items
                        will be added.

                    <p>
                        After NoHoomans Pub reaches this stage - it will mean that the first step towards building
                        Crypted Space will be complete.
                        Our capabilities and the full potential of the project’s further successful development will be
                        constantly demonstrated to the holders and investors
