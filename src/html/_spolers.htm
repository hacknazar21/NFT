                    <p>
                        The overall intensive growth of generative PFP collections in the NTF market creates an enormous
                        level of competitiveness nowadays. It is very hard to stand out in the crowded space of
                        collectibles, and deliver a special, unique product that will be able to allow potential owners
                        to
                        invest and expect high profitability. This is why our team works hard to implement a great
                        quality
                        into the project in order to generate a high ROI within the market.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To make this happen, we prepared a peculiar, eccentric PFP collection which will be considered
                        an
                        important aspect for progress in further strategic approach. Successful fundraising with our
                        collection will provide a great value, which in turn, will insure the proper development, and
                        outline the most important fields of the whole project itself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The cost of the whole Project development is estimated for a 2 year period. This period of time
                        implies the full preparation before releasing the finished game including all the added modules,
                        level design, asset design, game mechanics and marketing to operate at the full potential.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Holders of Aliens are considered as early backers of the project. They will be rewarded with
                        regular
                        airdrops from upcoming collections and collaborations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To provide the project with funds during the 2-year development period, we have prepared 3 main
                        collections, which will also have special functionality in the game. They are:

                            Alien NFT Collection - ___ size PFP collections of characters differ in traits and rarity.
                            When
                            “NoHoomans Pub” Pre-Alpha will be released, these characters will be remodeled and
                            integrated for
                            in-game use as playable skins and a key to access the NoHoomans Pub Location. Please keep in
                            mind
                            that the preparation of in-game skins will take time, most likely we will release them in
                            bunches
                            over 1 year.

                            Quarters - a smaller collection of rooms used as personal property by players. There players
                            will be
                            able to store their inventory, socialize with other players, play mini-games, and more. The
                            project
                            is looking forward to providing rooms with a high level of rarity for active players. These
                            active
                            members will have an opportunity to design a model of their room directly with our team of
                            developers by sharing ideas, considering personal requirements and creativity.

                            Exotic Ships - this will be the smallest collection, and the most special one respectively.
                            This
                            collection will include unique spaceships that owners will use in the game when we introduce
                            spaceship deathmatches in the game. Until then, spaceships will appear with the tagged names
                            of
                            proud owners in the “Hangar” section of the map.

                        The demo module of the Pub will be released and will operate as a “Social Hub” where all players
                        will be able to use different characters within the playable area. It will be available only for
                        PC

                        A primitive in-game multiplayer system will be implemented to allow gamers to interact with each
                        other using integrated methods of communication and entertainment inside the demo version. This
                        will
                        serve as a base foundation for new game mechanics that will be added gradually.

                        The early demo will not require wallet connection or account registration. Both methods of the
                        authorization will be added when spaceships, vendors, trading, and the whole token integrated
                        ecosystem are introduced in the later version of the game. This will provide further access to
                        the
                        Pub location only for owners of our Alien PFP collection.

                        Space will be complete. We will successfully demonstrate to backers and investors our
