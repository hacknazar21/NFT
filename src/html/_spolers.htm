                    All these characters will be remodeled for in-game use,
                    once the NoHoomans Pub releases in Early-Alpha.
                    2. Quarters - a smaller collection of NFT rooms that will directly be used
                    in-game as early as the Early-Alpha of the NoHoomans Pub release. Rooms
                    are private player locations in-game that can be used for hang-outs, inventory
                    display, and mini-games. We are planning to release some super-rare rooms
                    that we will give-away for being an active member of our community, these
                    rooms will be designed and modeled directly with the winner, incorporating his
                    ideas and needs in them.
                    3. Rides - a even smaller NFT collection that is consisted out of unique spaceships that will be
                    used in
                    the NoHoomans Pub release, this ships will be available to for use in-game once we introduce our
                    first
                    game-mode, which is
                    “Dog-fighting”, a 5 vs 5 team deathmatch. Until then the ships will be displayed
                    in the “Hangar” section of the map with the owners name-tag over them.</div>
